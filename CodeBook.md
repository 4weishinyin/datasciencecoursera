** Note: [3] - [68] stores the computed average of each of the 66 measurements of 
the mean and the standard deviation measurement per activity/subject. The field names 
shown at the data dictionary above, [3] -[68], are renames of the original data set
based on the following mechanism:
   
   For column names that
    
         1. match "BodyBody" pattern, the matched is substituted with "Body" 
            due to the typo in the data source
         2. start with "t", the matched is substituted with "Time"
         3. start with "f", the matched is substituted with "Frequency"
         4. match "Gyro" pattern, the matched is substituted with "Gyroscope"
         5. match "Acc" pattern, the matched is substituted with "Accelerometer"
         6. match "Mag" pattern, the matched is substituted with "Magnitude"
         7. match "()" or "-" pattern, the matched is removed
         8. retain "X", "Y", "Z" character representing the various axial direction

    As an example, the original name of the field name [4] was 'tBodyAccMeanY', it's 
    then transformed to 'TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY'. 
 
Also, the following information was extracted from the link provided by the course 
to assit readers understanding the terminologies used on the measurement data collected 
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial 
raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove 
noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of 
these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAcc-XYZ
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- fBodyGyro-XYZ
- fBodyAccMag
- fBodyAccJerkMag
- fBodyGyroMag
- fBodyGyroJerkMag

And the set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

- mean(): Mean value
- std(): Standard deviation
